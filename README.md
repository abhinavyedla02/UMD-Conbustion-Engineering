Completed Projects I have completed in Lab


Final Processing is a program that does FTIR Spectral Deconvolution. 
It is a program that determines the bonds of a sample thaat is processed using FTIR(diffuse/specular reflection analysis).
Uses Test.peaks, which is base values of FTIR. This program simply adjusts the bonds. Test.peaks is created from FITYK, a manual FTIR program

3d plot is used to wrap points together into a wireframe using triangulization and then I added a colormap to tell the depth
